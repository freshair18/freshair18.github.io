My name is Michael Sutton, a researcher and developer. My previous [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=an4Z0xwAAAAJ&hl=iw) focused on parallel graph algorithms and high-performance-computing. Currently, I am researching DAG consensus protocols and distributed systems and developing the Kaspa cryptocurrency.
